PinePhone firmware
------------------

PinePhone needs ATF and SCP firmware. For ATF to correctly interact with p-boot,
ATF needs to be patched, in order not to run U-Boot specific code.

This directory contains scripts that can be used to build the ATF and SCP
firmwares and a combined firmware package for p-boot, that will end up being
loaded into A64 SRAM A2. ATF and SCP share the same SRAM.


Build instructions
------------------

1) Get source code for ATF and SCP:

  git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware.git atf
  git clone https://github.com/crust-firmware/crust.git crust

2) Patch ATF to add p-boot support:

  ( cd atf ; git am ../atf.patch )

3) Get cross-compilers:

  You'll need to have aarch64-linux-musl and or1k-linux-musl toolchains
  in your PATH.

4) Build the firmware binary:

  ./build-all.sh


If everything goes fine, you should get fw.bin in the current directory.
