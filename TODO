- make poweroff on panic more robust
  - reset SoC with a flag in RTC data register to signal p-boot to
    perform poweroff right after pmic_init (also avoid reset loop)

- add boot selection tool
  - to write superblock default boot option
  - to write RTC data reg via devmem or add support for these regs to
    sysfs

- read i2c proximity sensor
  - abort boot and poweroff if pressing the power button
    when the proximity sensor is covered (phone in the bag,
    pocket, etc.)

- optimize bootfs creation tool to not overwrite the whole partition
  on each update

- test/use CONFIG_ATF_TO_LINUX

- audio / beep
  - signal boot issues via beeping on the loudspeaker

- pass p-boot log somehow to the kernel (via fdt property? /bootlog?)

- add HACKING file
  - fel boot tips / development

- FAT support
