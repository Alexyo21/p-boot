1.0: (est. mid to late May 2020)

- make poweroff on panic more robust
  - reset SoC with a flag in RTC data register to signal p-boot to
    perform poweroff right after pmic_init (also avoid reset loop)

- read i2c proximity sensor
  - abort boot and poweroff if pressing the power button
    when the proximity sensor is covered (phone in the bag,
    pocket, etc.)

- detect 1.0/1.1 vs 1.2 hardware and load appropriate DTB

- allow to override RTC based boot selection once, while restoring
  the previous RTC value (not resetting as now)

- pass p-boot log somehow to the kernel (via fdt property? /bootlog?)


2.0: (est. July 2020)

- fat support (will probably be slower than bootfs)


X.X: (est. ????)

- optimize bootfs creation tool to not overwrite the whole partition
  on each update

- audio / beep
  - signal boot issues via beeping on the loudspeaker
