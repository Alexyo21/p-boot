1.0: (est. December 2020)

- automatic selection of 1.1/1.2 DTS based on autodetection

- investigate timer erratum
  - upclocking may trigger it
  - or switching to 24MHz osc

- i2c support
  - touch screen support
    - virt keyboard?
  - read proximity sensor data
    - abort boot and poweroff if pressing the power button
      when the proximity sensor is covered (phone in the bag,
      pocket, etc.)

- audio support
  - signal boot issues via beeping on the loudspeaker
  - requires DMA (already done) + toggling a bunch of registers to
    enable the codec

- make poweroff on panic more robust
  - reset SoC with a flag in RTC data register to signal p-boot to
    perform poweroff right after pmic_init (also avoid reset loop)

X.X: (est. ????)

- ext2 support (will probably be slower than bootfs)
  - parse config from a *.conf file
