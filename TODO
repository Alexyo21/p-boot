- make poweroff on panic more robust
  - reset SoC with a flag in RTC data register to signal p-boot to
    perform poweroff right after pmic_init (also avoid reset loop)

- read i2c proximity sensor
  - abort boot and poweroff if pressing the power button
    when the proximity sensor is covered (phone in the bag,
    pocket, etc.)

- optimize bootfs creation tool to not overwrite the whole partition
  on each update

- audio / beep
  - signal boot issues via beeping on the loudspeaker

- pass p-boot log somehow to the kernel (via fdt property? /bootlog?)

- ext2 support
