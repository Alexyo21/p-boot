Using FEL to develop p-boot
---------------------------

You can use sunxi-fel tool from sunxi-tools to run p-boot over USB,
without the need to flash it to SD/eMMC:

  https://linux-sunxi.org/Sunxi-tools#sunxi-fel

Get sunxi tools here:

  git clone https://github.com/linux-sunxi/sunxi-tools


I recommend to remove the existing bootloader so that PinePhone starts
to FEL mode automatically:

  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1024 seek=8 count=2
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=1024 seek=8 count=2

  (if you're using 8 KiB offset for bootloader)
 

Then you can run:

  sunxi-fel -v spl p-boot.bin

to load the p-boot and start it.

For an even better workflow, if you don't actually need to run Linux
at the end, you can add soc_reset() just before jump_to_atf() and to
panic_shutdown(). This way, you will be able to perform a very
comfortable dev cycle of:

  # hack on code
  ninja
  sunxi-fel -v spl p-boot.bin

  ... repeat the above
